    - Display error toast when reset fails
    - Display error toast when non-host attempts reset
    - Handle network errors gracefully
    - _Requirements: 4.1_

- [ ] 6. Handle edge cases and host reassignment
  - [ ] 6.1 Test and verify host reassignment on leave
    - Verify that when host leaves a completed game, a new host is assigned
    - Verify new host can reset the game
    - Verify "Play Again" button appears for new host
    - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3_
