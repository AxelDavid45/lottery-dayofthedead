# Card Calling Mechanics - Implementation Summary

## Task 6: Desarrollar mecánica de cantado de cartas ✅

### Sub-tasks Completed:

#### 1. ✅ Implementar loop de cantado cada 4 segundos
**Location:** `server/src/utils/room-manager.js` - `startCardCalling()` method

```javascript
// Start calling cards every 4 seconds
room.gameInterval = setInterval(() => {
  this.callNextCard(roomCode, io);
}, GAME_CONSTANTS.CARD_INTERVAL); // 4000ms = 4 seconds
```

**Features:**
- Uses `setInterval` with 4-second interval (defined in `GAME_CONSTANTS.CARD_INTERVAL`)
- Calls first card immediately upon game start
- Stores interval reference in `room.gameInterval` for cleanup
- Automatically stops when game ends

#### 2. ✅ Crear sistema de sincronización de cartas para todos los jugadores
**Location:** `server/src/utils/room-manager.js` - `callNextCard()` method

```javascript
// Broadcast the card to all players in the room
io.to(roomCode).emit("game:card", {
  card: card,
  drawIndex: room.drawIndex,
  totalCards: room.deck.length,
  drawnCards: Array.from(room.drawnCards)
});
```

**Features:**
- Uses Socket.IO room broadcasting (`io.to(roomCode).emit()`)
- Sends complete card object with name and emoji
- Includes progress tracking (drawIndex/totalCards)
- Sends full history of drawn cards for synchronization
- All players receive the same card at the same time

#### 3. ✅ Manejar barajado inicial y orden de cantado
**Location:** `server/src/utils/room-manager.js` - `startGame()` method

```javascript
// Generate unique boards for all players
const { shuffledDeck, boards } = generateBoardsForRoom(room.players.size);

// Set up game state
room.deck = shuffledDeck;
room.drawIndex = 0;
room.drawnCards = new Set();
```

**Features:**
- Shuffles deck at game start using `generateBoardsForRoom()`
- Stores shuffled deck in room state
- Initializes `drawIndex` to 0
- Cards are called in the shuffled order
- No card repetition during a game
- Deck contains all 24 themed cards

#### 4. ✅ Implementar historial de cartas cantadas
**Location:** `server/src/utils/room-manager.js` - `callNextCard()` method

```javascript
// Add to drawn cards and increment index
room.drawnCards.add(cardId);
room.drawIndex++;
```

**Features:**
- Uses `Set` data structure for efficient lookup
- Accumulates all called cards in `room.drawnCards`
- Sent to clients with each card event
- Used for board marking validation
- Used for victory claim validation
- Persists throughout the game

## Integration Points:

### Socket Events:
- **`game:started`** - Triggered when game begins, includes initial state
- **`game:card`** - Broadcast every 4 seconds with new card
- **`game:winner`** - Stops card calling when winner is declared

### Validation:
- Board marking validates against `drawnCards` set
- Victory claims validate all marked cards are in `drawnCards`
- Prevents marking cards that haven't been called

### Cleanup:
- `stopCardCalling()` clears interval when:
  - Game ends (winner declared)
  - Room is deleted
  - All players disconnect
  - Room expires (2-hour TTL)

## Requirements Satisfied:

✅ **Requisito 4.1** - Cards displayed visually for 4 seconds using Socket.IO
✅ **Requisito 4.2** - Cards called from shuffled deck without repetition
✅ **Requisito 4.4** - Exactly 4 seconds pause between each card
✅ **Requisito 4.5** - Card visualization synchronized for all players via WebSockets
✅ **Requisito 8.4** - Cards called in shuffled order without repetition

## Testing:

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Card calling interval (4 seconds)
- ✅ Card synchronization across multiple clients
- ✅ Unique cards (no repetition)
- ✅ Sequential draw indices
- ✅ Drawn cards history accumulation
- ✅ Board marking integration

**Test files:**
- `tests/test-card-calling.js` - Comprehensive test
- `tests/test-card-calling-quick.js` - Quick verification test

## Implementation Status: COMPLETE ✅

All sub-tasks for Task 6 have been successfully implemented and tested.
